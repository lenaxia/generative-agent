## Test Failure Categories

### Category 1: Legacy/Obsolete Tests (REMOVE)

These tests are testing functionality that has been removed or significantly refactored:

1. **`tests/integration/test_migration_validation.py`** - 8 failures

   - Tests backward compatibility with removed architecture
   - Tests "legacy vs new" performance comparisons

3. **`tests/integration/test_real_world_scenarios.py`** - 9 failures

   - Similar to advanced scenarios, testing old patterns
   - **Action:** REVIEW and likely DELETE

4. **`tests/integration/test_end_to_end_workflows.py`** - 10 failures

   - **Action:** FIX BUG or UPDATE TEST for new architecture

5. **`tests/unit/test_error_handling_unit.py::test_tool_function_network_timeout`** - 1 failure

   - **Issue:** Network timeout not handled properly
   - **Action:** FIX BUG in error handling

6. **`tests/unit/test_error_handling_unit.py::test_workflow_engine_task_execution_failure`** - 1 failure
   - **Issue:** Task execution failure not handled properly
   - **Action:** FIX BUG in workflow engine

### Category 3: Tests Needing Rewrite (UPDATE TESTS)

These tests are valid but need updates for the new architecture:

1. **`tests/test_intent_processor.py::test_process_workflow_intent`** - 1 failure

   - Test needs update for new intent processing architecture
   - **Action:** REWRITE for Phase 2 intent detection

2. **`tests/supervisor/test_workflow_engine.py`** - 8 failures

   - Tests need updates for consolidated workflow engine
   - **Action:** REWRITE for new WorkflowEngine architecture

3. **`tests/unit/test_workflow_engine_unit.py::test_start_workflow_success`** - 1 failure

   - **Action:** REWRITE for new workflow start mechanism

4. **`tests/integration/test_planning_role_execution.py`** - 3 failures

   - Tests need updates for single-file role architecture
   - **Action:** REWRITE for new planning role implementation

5. **`tests/integration/test_unified_result_storage.py::test_complex_workflow_still_works`** - 1 failure
   - **Action:** REWRITE for new result storage mechanism

### Category 4: Tests That Should Pass (INVESTIGATE)

These tests should be passing but aren't - need investigation:

None identified yet - all failures categorized above.

## Detailed Failure Analysis

### High Priority Fixes (Actual Bugs)

1. **Conversation Memory Bug** (`test_conversation_prompt_injection.py`)

   - Height data `'6\'4"'` not appearing in prompt context
   - Location: `common/providers/redis_memory_provider.py` or conversation formatting
   - Impact: User data not being properly included in conversations

2. **Empty Cache Handling** (`test_conversation_memory_integration.py`)

   - Redis empty cache not handled gracefully
   - Location: `common/providers/redis_memory_provider.py`
   - Impact: System may crash on empty cache

3. **Timer Heartbeat Issues** (`test_timer_system_integration.py`)

   - Fast heartbeat not publishing events
   - Location: `roles/core_timer.py` or `supervisor/supervisor.py`
   - Impact: Timer notifications may not fire

4. **Error Handling Gaps** (`test_error_handling_unit.py`)
   - Network timeouts not handled
   - Task execution failures not handled
   - Location: Various error handling code
   - Impact: System crashes instead of graceful degradation

### Medium Priority (Test Rewrites)

1. **Intent Processor Tests** - Update for Phase 2 architecture
2. **Workflow Engine Tests** - Update for consolidated engine
3. **Planning Role Tests** - Update for single-file roles

### Low Priority (Legacy Test Removal)

1. **Migration Validation Tests** - Delete entire file
2. **Advanced E2E Scenarios** - Review and likely delete
3. **Real World Scenarios** - Review and likely delete
4. **Old E2E Workflows** - Review and rewrite or delete

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Fix the 6 actual bugs identified** in Category 2
2. **Delete migration validation tests** - no longer relevant
3. **Update todo list** to track progress

### Short Term Actions

1. **Rewrite 13 tests** that need architecture updates
2. **Review and delete** legacy test files (estimated 30+ tests)
3. **Run tests again** after fixes to verify

### Long Term Actions

1. **Add test coverage** for new single-file role architecture
2. **Document test strategy** for future development
3. **Set up CI/CD** to catch regressions early

## Test Files to Delete

Based on git history and architecture changes:

1. `tests/integration/test_migration_validation.py` - Migration complete
2. Potentially `tests/integration/test_advanced_end_to_end_scenarios.py` - Old architecture
3. Potentially `tests/integration/test_real_world_scenarios.py` - Old architecture
4. Potentially `tests/integration/test_end_to_end_workflows.py` - Needs major rewrite or delete

## Tests That Are Passing and Should Be Kept

- All Phase 2 intent detection tests ✓
- Threading fix validation tests ✓
- Docker Redis setup tests ✓
- Context-aware integration tests ✓
- Task context and graph tests ✓
- Single-file role tests ✓
- Most unit tests ✓

## Next Steps

1. Create detailed bug fix plan for Category 2 issues
2. Delete migration validation tests
3. Review and categorize remaining legacy tests
4. Rewrite tests for new architecture
5. Ensure all valid tests pass
6. Update documentation

## Metrics

- **Bug Fixes Needed:** 6
- **Tests to Rewrite:** 13
- **Tests to Delete:** ~30-40 (estimated)
- **Tests to Keep:** 113 (currently passing)
- **Target Pass Rate:** 100% after cleanup
