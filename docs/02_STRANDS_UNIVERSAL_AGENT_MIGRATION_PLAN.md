# StrandsAgent Universal Agent Migration Plan

## Overview

This document provides a revised migration plan based on the **Universal Agent + External State Management** paradigm. After analyzing the current project structure, we've identified excellent foundations that can be leveraged and enhanced rather than replaced.

## Rules

- ALWAYS use test driven development, write tests first
- Never assume tests pass, run the tests and positively verify that the test passed
- ALWAYS run all tests after making any change to ensure they are still all passing, do not move on until relevant tests are passing
- If a test fails, reflect deeply about why the test failed and fix it or fix the code
- Always write multiple tests, including happy, unhappy path and corner cases
- Always verify interfaces and data structures before writing code, do not assume the definition of a interface or data structure
- When performing refactors, ALWAYS use grep to find all instances that need to be refactored
- If you are stuck in a debugging cycle and can't seem to make forward progress, either ask for user input or take a step back and reflect on the broader scope of the code you're working on
- ALWAYS make sure your tests are meaningful, do not mock excessively, only mock where ABSOLUTELY necessary.
- Make a git commit after major changes have been completed
- When refactoring an object, refactor it in place, do not create a new file just for the sake of preserving the old version, we have git for that reason. For instance, if refactoring RequestManager, do NOT create an EnhancedRequestManager, just refactor or rewrite RequestManager
- ALWAYS Follow development and language best practices
- Use the Context7 MCP server if you need documentation for something, make sure you're looking at the right version
- Remember we are migrating AWAY from langchain TO strands agent
- Do not worry about backwards compatibility unless it is PART of a migration process and you will remove the backwards compatibility later
- Do not use fallbacks
- Whenever you complete a phase, make sure to update this checklist
- Don't just blindly implement changes. Reflect on them to make sure they make sense within the larger project. Pull in other files if additional context is needed

## Migration Benefits

### **Simplified Architecture:**

- **Before**: 5 agent classes + complex orchestration
- **After**: 1 Universal Agent + enhanced TaskGraph

### **Phase 6: Architecture Optimization (Week 6)**

#### **Epic 6.1: WorkflowEngine Consolidation**

**Goal**: Merge RequestManager + TaskScheduler into unified WorkflowEngine for simplified architecture

##### User Story 6.1.1: As a developer, I want a unified WorkflowEngine that combines request lifecycle and task scheduling

- [x] Extract `handle_request()`, `_create_task_plan()`, and `pause_request()`/`resume_request()` methods from RequestManager
- [x] Extract `schedule_task()`, `_process_task_queue()`, and concurrency control logic from TaskScheduler
- [x] Create WorkflowEngine class with unified interface: `start_workflow()`, `pause_workflow()`, `resume_workflow()`
- [x] Implement `_execute_dag_parallel()` method combining DAG traversal with priority-based task execution
- [x] Preserve agent_id → role mapping and LLMType optimization (STRONG for planning, WEAK for search/weather)
- [x] Maintain TaskContext integration for external state, conversation history, and checkpoints
- [x] Implement message bus subscriptions for TASK_RESPONSE and AGENT_ERROR events
- [x] Add workflow metrics combining request tracking and task queue statistics

```python
# Unified WorkflowEngine Implementation
class WorkflowEngine:
    """Unified workflow management with DAG execution and state persistence."""

    def __init__(self, llm_factory: LLMFactory, message_bus: MessageBus):
        self.universal_agent = UniversalAgent(llm_factory)
        self.active_workflows: Dict[str, TaskContext] = {}
        self.max_concurrent_tasks = 5
        self.running_tasks: Dict[str, TaskNode] = {}
        self.message_bus = message_bus

    # Request lifecycle (from RequestManager)
    def start_workflow(self, instruction: str) -> str:
        """Create and start a new workflow from user instruction."""
        workflow_id = self._generate_workflow_id()
        task_context = self._create_task_plan(instruction, workflow_id)
        self.active_workflows[workflow_id] = task_context
        self._execute_dag_parallel(task_context)
        return workflow_id

    # Task scheduling (from TaskScheduler)
    def _execute_dag_parallel(self, task_context: TaskContext):
        """Execute DAG with parallel task execution and concurrency control."""
        ready_tasks = task_context.get_ready_tasks()
        for task in ready_tasks:
            if len(self.running_tasks) < self.max_concurrent_tasks:
                self._execute_task_async(task_context, task)

    # State management (enhanced)
    def pause_workflow(self, workflow_id: str) -> Dict:
        """Pause workflow and create comprehensive checkpoint."""
        task_context = self.active_workflows[workflow_id]
        return task_context.pause_execution()

    def resume_workflow(self, workflow_id: str, checkpoint: Dict):
        """Resume workflow from checkpoint with full state restoration."""
        task_context = TaskContext.from_checkpoint(checkpoint)
        self.active_workflows[workflow_id] = task_context
        task_context.resume_execution()
        self._execute_dag_parallel(task_context)
```

##### User Story 6.1.2: As a developer, I want to migrate existing RequestManager and TaskScheduler to WorkflowEngine

- [x] Refactor `supervisor/request_manager.py` in place to become WorkflowEngine (preserve git history)
- [x] Move TaskScheduler's priority queue (`heapq` + `QueuedTask` dataclass) into WorkflowEngine
- [x] Integrate TaskScheduler's `max_concurrent_tasks` and `running_tasks` dict into WorkflowEngine
- [x] Combine RequestManager's `request_contexts` dict with TaskScheduler's task tracking
- [x] Update Supervisor's `__init__` to create WorkflowEngine instead of RequestManager
- [x] Migrate `tests/supervisor/test_strands_request_manager.py` and `test_task_scheduler.py` to `test_workflow_engine.py`
- [x] Update `supervisor.py` line 110 to use WorkflowEngine constructor
- [x] Delete `supervisor/task_scheduler.py` file after migration complete

### **Benefits of WorkflowEngine Consolidation**

#### **Simplified Architecture**

- **Before**: Supervisor → RequestManager → TaskScheduler → UniversalAgent → StrandsAgent
- **After**: Supervisor → WorkflowEngine → UniversalAgent → StrandsAgent

#### **Specific Capabilities Preserved**

- **Task Delegation**: ✅ `_determine_role_from_agent_id()` mapping (planning_agent → planning, search_agent → search)
- **Multi-threading**: ✅ `max_concurrent_tasks=5` with `running_tasks` dict and `heapq` priority queue
- **DAG Planning**: ✅ `TaskGraph.get_ready_tasks()` and dependency resolution via `TaskContext`
- **External State**: ✅ `pause_workflow()`/`resume_workflow()` using `TaskContext.create_checkpoint()`
- **Error Handling**: ✅ `handle_task_error()` with `max_retries=3` and `retry_delay=1.0`
- **LLM Optimization**: ✅ Semantic model selection (STRONG for planning, WEAK for search/weather, DEFAULT for summarizer/slack)

#### **Concrete Implementation Benefits**

- **Single File**: One `supervisor/workflow_engine.py` instead of two separate files
- **Unified State**: Combined `active_workflows` dict instead of separate `request_contexts` and `task_queue`
- **Direct Communication**: No message bus overhead between request lifecycle and task scheduling

### **Phase 7: Complete LangChain Removal (Week 7)**

#### **Epic 7.1: Supervisor Migration to StrandsAgent-Only**

**Goal**: Remove LangChain dependencies from Supervisor and AgentManager

##### User Story 7.1.1: As a developer, I want Supervisor to work without AgentManager or LangChain dependencies
