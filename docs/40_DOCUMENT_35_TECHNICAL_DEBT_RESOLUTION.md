# Document 35 Technical Debt Resolution

**Document ID:** 36
**Created:** 2025-10-28
**Status:** Technical Debt Cleanup
**Priority:** High
**Context:** Document 35 Phase 1 Implementation Cleanup

## Rules

- Regularly run `make lint` to validate that your code is healthy
- Always use the venv at ./venv/bin/activate
- ALWAYS use test driven development, write tests first
- Never assume tests pass, run the tests and positively verify that the test passed
- ALWAYS run all tests after making any change to ensure they are still all passing, do not move on until relevant tests are passing
- If a test fails, reflect deeply about why the test failed and fix it or fix the code
- Always write multiple tests, including happy, unhappy path and corner cases
- Always verify interfaces and data structures before writing code, do not assume the definition of a interface or data structure
- When performing refactors, ALWAYS use grep to find all instances that need to be refactored
- If you are stuck in a debugging cycle and can't seem to make forward progress, either ask for user input or take a step back and reflect on the broader scope of the code you're working on
- ALWAYS make sure your tests are meaningful, do not mock excessively, only mock where ABSOLUTELY necessary.
- Make a git commit after major changes have been completed
- When refactoring an object, refactor it in place, do not create a new file just for the sake of preserving the old version, we have git for that reason. For instance, if refactoring RequestManager, do NOT create an EnhancedRequestManager, just refactor or rewrite RequestManager
- ALWAYS Follow development and language best practices
- Use the Context7 MCP server if you need documentation for something, make sure you're looking at the right version
- Remember we are migrating AWAY from langchain TO strands agent
- Do not worry about backwards compatibility unless it is PART of a migration process and you will remove the backwards compatibility later
- Do not use fallbacks. Fallbacks tend to be brittle and fragile. Do implement fallbacks of any kind.
- Whenever you complete a phase, make sure to update this checklist
- Don't just blindly implement changes. Reflect on them to make sure they make sense within the larger project. Pull in other files if additional context is needed
- When you complete the implementation of a project add new todo items addressing outstanding technical debt related to what you just implemented, such as removing old code, updating documentation, searching for additional references, etc. Fix these issues, do not accept technical debt for the project being implemented.

## Executive Summary

This document identifies and resolves ALL technical debt created during Document 35 Phase 1 implementation. Following the rules above, we will not accept any technical debt and will clean up all issues before proceeding to Phase 2.

## Technical Debt Identified

### 1. Dual Function Problem

**Issue**: Both `execute_task_graph` (old) and `create_workflow_execution_intent` (new) exist
**Impact**: Confusion about which function to use, duplicate functionality
**Resolution**: Update `execute_task_graph` to delegate to new function for backward compatibility

### 2. Failing Unit Tests

**Issue**: 20+ test references to old `execute_task_graph` behavior expecting string returns
**Impact**: Tests failing because function behavior changed
**Resolution**: Update all test assertions to match new intent-based behavior

### 3. Failing Integration Tests

**Issue**: Integration tests expect old string return format
**Impact**: Integration test failures breaking CI/CD
**Resolution**: Update integration test assertions for new behavior

### 4. Type Annotation Inconsistencies

**Issue**: Missing or incorrect type annotations in new functions
**Impact**: Type checking errors, reduced code quality
**Resolution**: Add proper type annotations throughout

### 5. Import References

**Issue**: Tests and other files import old function behavior
**Impact**: Confusion about which function provides which behavior
**Resolution**: Update all import references and documentation

### 6. Legacy Execution Logic

**Issue**: Old complex execution logic still exists in execute_task_graph
**Impact**: Code bloat, maintenance burden, potential bugs
**Resolution**: Remove old execution logic, delegate to new intent function

## Technical Debt Resolution Plan

### Phase 1: Core Function Cleanup

**Duration**: 1 day
**Priority**: Critical

#### Tasks

- [ ] **Update execute_task_graph to delegate to create_workflow_execution_intent**

  - File: `roles/core_planning.py`
  - Change: Replace complex execution with simple delegation
  - Maintain backward compatibility for existing tests
  - Risk: Low

- [ ] **Remove old execution logic from execute_task_graph**

  - File: `roles/core_planning.py`
  - Change: Clean up complex workflow execution code
  - Keep only intent creation and status message return
  - Risk: Low

- [ ] **Add proper imports and type annotations**
  - File: `roles/core_planning.py`
  - Change: Add WorkflowExecutionIntent import, fix type annotations
  - Ensure all functions have proper typing
  - Risk: Very Low

#### Success Criteria

- [ ] execute_task_graph delegates to create_workflow_execution_intent
- [ ] All old execution logic removed
- [ ] Proper type annotations added
- [ ] File has no syntax errors

### Phase 2: Test Updates

**Duration**: 2 days
**Priority**: High

#### Tasks

- [ ] **Update TestExecuteTaskGraph class**

  - File: `tests/unit/test_planning_role.py`
  - Change: Update all 8 test methods to expect new behavior
  - Update assertions from string checks to intent-based checks
  - Risk: Medium

- [ ] **Update integration tests**

  - File: `tests/integration/test_planning_role_execution.py`
  - Change: Update 4 test methods to expect new behavior
  - Update assertions for intent-based workflow initiation
  - Risk: Medium

- [ ] **Fix failing unit tests in test_planning_role_intent_creation.py**
  - File: `tests/unit/test_planning_role_intent_creation.py`
  - Change: Update remaining 4 failing tests to match new behavior
  - Fix test logic for exception handling
  - Risk: Low

#### Success Criteria

- [ ] All TestExecuteTaskGraph tests pass
- [ ] All integration tests pass
- [ ] All unit tests for intent creation pass
- [ ] No test failures related to planning role

### Phase 3: Reference Updates

**Duration**: 1 day
**Priority**: Medium

#### Tasks

- [ ] **Search and update all execute_task_graph references**

  - Files: All test files and documentation
  - Change: Update comments, docstrings, and references
  - Ensure consistency across codebase
  - Risk: Low

- [ ] **Update function documentation**

  - File: `roles/core_planning.py`
  - Change: Update docstrings to reflect new intent-based behavior
  - Document the delegation pattern
  - Risk: Very Low

- [ ] **Clean up unused imports**
  - Files: All modified files
  - Change: Remove unused imports, add missing imports
  - Run import optimization tools
  - Risk: Very Low

#### Success Criteria

- [ ] All references to execute_task_graph are accurate
- [ ] Documentation reflects current behavior
